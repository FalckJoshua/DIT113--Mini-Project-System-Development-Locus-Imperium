# Introduction

## Why the project is useful

- By knowing the room temperature you are able to tell if the temperature is too high or not.

- By knowing how many people are in the room you are able to tell if the safety hazard is broken.

- By knowing the humidity you are able to determine if actions neccessary. Example high humidity leads to mold formation.

- This information could be useful to determine a relation between the ammount of people in the room and the air quality.
