# Introduction

## Why the project is useful

- By knowing the room temperature you are able to tell if the temperature is too high or not.

- By knowing how many people are in the room you are able to tell if the safety hazard is broken.

- By knowing the humidity you are able to determine if actions necessary. Example high humidity leads to mold formation.

- This information could be useful to determine a relation between the amount of people in the room and the air quality.

## Initial setup
> Before starting, ensure you have the following [prerequisites](#prerequisites)

## Setting up WIO Terminal
1. Clone the repository 
   ```
   git clone https://git.chalmers.se/courses/dit113/2023/group-6/group-6.git
   ```
2. Connect the Wio Terminal to your computer
3. Open the installation folder and select the folder for your operating system.
4. Execute the  `run` file.
5. Enter values for your WiFi and broker address. See [how to find your IPv4.](#how-to-find-your-ipv4)
6. Done

### How to find your IPv4
<details>
<summary> Expand </summary>

- Open a terminal, run the command: Windows: `ipconfig` | MacOS: `/sbin/ifconfig` | Linux: *you know how to do it already*.

- Find and select:
"Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi: IPv4 Address"
